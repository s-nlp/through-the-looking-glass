# Through the Looking Glass
This is a subset of our WEIRD dataset that we used to evaluate the Through the Looking Glass (TGL) approach to common sense violation detection in images. There are 30 images along with annotations in data.jsonl. 

Example of the dataset sample:
```
{
  'id': 11, # A unique id of the sample
  'path': 'images/image_11', # Path to the image
  'commonsense_violation_group': 'Object Function and Misuse', # The main group of the common sense violation manually annotated using generated subgroups
  'commonsense_violation_subgroup': 'Inappropriate tool usage', # The subgroup of the common sense violation generated by GPT
  'class': 'normal' # The class (normal / weird)
}
```
